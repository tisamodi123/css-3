            The goal of formatting is to look professional and make the story easy to read. A little bit of style is OK but you don’t want to take big risks or do anything strange or distracting. In fact, most of my

            decorations or fancy fonts is probably a bad idea.The goal of formatting is to look professional and make the story easy to read. A little bit of style is OK but you don’t want to take big risks or do anything strange or distracting. In fact, most of my templates
